# gpt-flow
**GPT Flow** is my attempt to simplify and improve upon '**autogpt**' By harnessing the capabilities of GPT models, I'm developing a tool that makes complex tasks easier and mirrors human thinking. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and effective solution that automates processes, addressing the challenges of usability and potential looping that 'autogpt' faces.
